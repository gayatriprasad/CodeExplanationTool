# CodeExplanationTool

I'll provide an overview of each step, and then we can move on to the coding phase for these parts.

Project Setup and Environment Configuration


Set up a Python virtual environment
Install necessary libraries (e.g., ast for parsing, nltk for NLP)
Create project structure and main files


Input Handling and Code Parsing


Develop a function to accept Python code input
Implement error handling for invalid code
Create a basic preprocessing function to clean and standardize the input


Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Generation and Analysis


Use Python's ast module to generate an AST from the input code
Develop functions to traverse the AST and extract relevant information
Create data structures to store extracted information


Explanation Template Design


Design a set of templates for different code constructs (e.g., functions, loops, conditionals)
Create a mapping between AST node types and explanation templates
Implement a system to fill in templates with specific code details


Natural Language Processing (NLP) Integration


Integrate NLTK or a similar NLP library
Implement text processing functions (e.g., tokenization, part-of-speech tagging)
Develop algorithms to enhance explanation readability and naturalness


Explanation Generation Algorithm


Create the main explanation generation function
Implement logic to combine AST analysis, templates, and NLP processing
Develop a system to generate coherent multi-line explanations
